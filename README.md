# M7IFTTT
CMDJ1M7 â€“ Integrated Smart Systems, Week 1 of IFTTT. An assignment in which we have to make a smart system inspired on the internet of things. The system listens to an arduino sensor value which is emitted to a server by the arduino wifi shield. A web application reads those values and settles you with an interactive UI. The interaction a user makes within the UI sends another set of data to the server which get's back to the arduino and drives an actuator.
